# NoAirMovement

Removes your ability to control yourself while falling, client sided.

## What this mod does

It makes surviving falls a lot harder, since you have no control over your velocity. This could be considered a mod making the game more realistic.
This mod is made for clients, that means server admins cannot enforce having this mod installed (might be changed in a future update).

## Dependencies

None! Like most of my mods, it works out of the box.
